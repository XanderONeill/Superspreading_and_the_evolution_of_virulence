# Read Me File for the PLOS Computational Biology paper titled: "Superspreading and the evolution of virulence" 

Example MATLAB code for results obtained in the "Superspreading and the evolution of virulence" article by O'Neill et al.

Within the deterministic simulations folder are three subfolders in which the user can choose to obtain the deterministic trajectories as acquired in Figure 2, S3, S4 and S6

Within the stochastic simulations folder are three subfolders in which the user can choose to obtain the stochastic trajectories as acquired in Figures 2, S3, S4 and S6. Note, that due to the random nature of these simulations any data may not exactly match those shown in the respective figures. However, the behaviour should be qualitatively similar. 

Within the Figure 3 folder is code in which the user can obtain the ESS curves found in Figure 3. This code uses the function d = d(c) as detailed in the main paper. However, it is straightforward to adapt this into d = 1 and choose one of the vulnerability or tolerance functions for h(c) as detailed in the main paper and in the respective deterministic/stochastic code folders.
